    a little song by WHALE:
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once?
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills too
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once? (Yeah)
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight (one time)
    Maybe I can give you chills too (chill)
    I'm gettin' mine like fine wine measured in time
    Many other brothers loved you but this pleasure is mine
    It's no pressure for us to say that I love you for now
    So fuck that cuffin' shit, I just want us be comfortable now, for real
    Who you lovin'? Who you wanna pull up with?
    Who don't care you datin' long as you care and you trust him
    Tryna hear all your problems so I can lighten the load
    No you're not fighting alone
    'Cause I'm protectin' you from 'em, so chill
    Life hard and ex lovers is like scars
    'Cause they stop hurtin' but never forgettin' what it was
    I was a youngin' my biggest enemy was the club
    Voicemails on third rings fucked me up, so I don't trust
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once? (Tryin' slow up)
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills too
    We've been on a tragedy for months (months)
    Why can't you agree with me for once? (Yeah)
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills too (aye shawty, look)
    Okay, they switch up on you I'm gonna stay the same
    I pull up on you then put it in with patience
    I'm good where we got it without no expectations
    What good is a tidal when shawty been the wave? Yeah
    Let me illustrate, ya
    Let my tongue re-paint ya
    It's already wet, have you had a brain storm?
    Er'where a nigga take you, just know that my face good
    Modify your energy so your bank and your skin glow
    Max field let it fly
    I be up in there a lot
    Just to show you I don't care, go wear it to that nigga house
    We don't share our whereabouts, or the gossip the hood love
    Just supreme confidence, if we good that's good enough, whoa, yeah
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once?
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills too
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once? (Yeah)
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills
    How about that, ohh?
    I'm tired of makin' up and fallin' out
    Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
    That pick your body up when you down and out (let's chill)
    How about that, ohh?
    I'm tired of makin' up and fallin' out
    Wanna be the nigga you callin' up
    That pick your body up when you down and out (let's chill)
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once?
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills too
    We've been on a tragedy for months
    Why can't you agree with me for once? (Yeah)
    Maybe we can be on chill tonight
    Maybe I can give you chills too
